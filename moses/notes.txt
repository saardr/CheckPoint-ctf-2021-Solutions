HELLO WE GOT THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE FROM ONE OF OUR SPIES BUT SHE COULD NOT SPACE BETWEEN LETTERS AND WORDS WE KNOW SHE WAS TRYING TO SEND A SEQUENCE OF WORDS AS THEY APPEAR IN THIS BOOK HELP US FIND THE SEQUENCE UNFORTUNATELLY SOME OF TONES WERE NOT CLEAR SO WE REPLACED THEM WITH X BECAUSE WE WERE NOT SURE IF IT WAS A DOT OR A LINE

--------------------
...-...-...-..----......-.---..-.-.....---.....--.-.-..--.----..-......-.---.-..
--------------------

THE FLAG IS THE SEQUENCE SEPARATED BY UNDERSCORES INSIDE CURLY BRACKETS AFTER UPPERCASE CSA


IDEA:
translate the entire book to morse code.
then remove spaces between morse letters.
lastly, use regex to find all matches for the re pattern.

Result:
it worked perfectly!! found just 1 match for the pattern (pasted above)
all that is left to do is translate it.
we can do this by remembering the length of every word.
finally we get

STILLOTHEROFTHEMTHATAREGONEBEFORE

(it indeed matches:)
... - .. .-.. .-.. --- - .... . .-. --- ..-. - .... . -- - .... .- - .- .-. . --. --- -. . -... . ..-. --- .-. .

therefore the flag is:

CSA{still_other_of_them_that_are_gone_before}
