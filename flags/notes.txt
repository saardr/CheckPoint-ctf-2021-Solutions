line 51: no check if there are enough coins when buying flag
		 can also own the flag more than once (owned_flags is a list, not set)

		 there is a check on line 146 though.

line 56: no check if actually owns the flag when selling.


can sell the same flag multiple times by:
1) buying several flags. more than 1 for sure.
2) choose which one i want to sell
3) when asked for how many flags, say max ammount.
4) sell it normally once.
5) the next time when asked what index to sell, enter an invalid index. the simplest is -1.
this is using the fact the flag_to_sell is set to None only once, on line 181, outside the loop.

aim for an error at str(user)? (line 147)
we can do this by buying the russia flag as the sole flag after tricking to increase the money.

so to conclude the exploit is:
