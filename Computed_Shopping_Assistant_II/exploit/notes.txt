POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
0) load coupons into memory
1) remove all coupons but the 100 one.
2) add 2 items, they can be anything.
for i in range 1...len(flag):
    3) remove the 100 coupon
    4) add a new item - fruit.
    5) edit the ammount of loaves to i.
    6) edit the ammount of items to 0.
    7) try to edit (can't edit therefore transpose back to coupon)
    8) try discovered + all ascii printables until we get a match.
    9) append the correct printable to discovered. if it is '}' break.

How to know when to stop: get the length by editing type to bread. then print, the ammount of loaves is the length of the flag.
this solution uses the memcmp in main.c line 223
