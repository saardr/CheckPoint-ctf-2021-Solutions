Once we have extracted the lsbit from the triangular series indexed pixels, we are left with 724 bits.
The question seems to be what to do with them now.

  perhaps, instead of extracting the lsbits from the triangular series indexed pixels, i should instead:
    - get the lsbits. transform them into a byte list. then do a triangular series over the resulting byte list.
      the issue i have with this is it doesn't quite make sense considering the wording for the second hint:
      "lsbit steganography over triangular series"

      Tried this approach, result didn't seem to be random other than the fact there were 32,768=2^15 bytes.
    
The 724-bit sequence is:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
and when translated to bytes (using 8 bits for each byte):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[57, 148, 53, 59, 217, 48, 183, 199, 223, 77, 238, 120, 158, 224, 18, 82, 31, 124, 101, 8, 223, 60, 189, 163, 189, 254, 170, 174, 67, 1, 90, 242, 70, 1, 53, 78, 180, 221, 141, 42, 42, 215, 128, 222, 225, 143, 57, 245, 234, 137, 75, 168, 207, 6, 61, 85, 33, 94, 202, 15, 58, 242, 102, 250, 46, 206, 12, 104, 130, 122, 217, 252, 226, 114, 126, 31, 189, 12, 163, 3, 80, 66, 217, 25, 159, 139, 202, 75, 72, 22, 11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
which when converted to ascii is just jibberish. That's where im stuck.
